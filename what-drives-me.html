<h2>What I'm looking for in my work</h2>
Dynamic/Challenging Environment - while I've only worked in two companies over my 13 year IT career, I've changed my career focus about every two years.  Sometimes because what I was doing wasn't the best fit - but always because I need to be continually challenged.  I want (/"need") to be challenged on a continual basis.


Being able to apply creativity throughout the entire software development process - from user analysis research, to database / schema modelling, to the tests, all the way through putting the final interaction design pieces in.  (while I feel I understand the tenents and advantages of TDD, it goes against the very core of how I develop for the user first
I love designing great software for users - that process for me includes learning as much as I can about the user - their thoughts, their needs, and generally their problemset.  I like to develop a genuine interest and learn about as much as possible about the user (meaning, I ask a lot of "Why?") questions


I'm also an optimist - I'm a strong believer in the "yes, and" approach (yes, borrowed from impromptu) and really don't like



Added Bonuses for me
Flexible(ish) working schedule / remote working opportunities - I'm a strong believer in getting what needs to be done, done.  Regardless of work hours.
