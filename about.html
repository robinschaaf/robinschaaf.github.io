<h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
I've been in database/web development since graduating with my B.S. in Computer Technology from Purdue in 2001.  Over the years, this has meant:
 <ul>
  <li>(The standards):  HTML, Javascript (yes, pre-jQuery!), CSS</li>
  <li>Perl / Postgresql  - In my spare time I developed a user-content driven site, mailleartisans.org, which is still in use today.  This was done in about 2002, well before myspace started or other user content driven sites.  If only I'd picked something with broader appeal than chainmail! :-)</li>
  <li>Coldfusion / Oracle, and some Java (while I worked for Discover Financial)</li>
  <li>ETL Development, Data Mart/Data Warehousing with Ab Initio (also at Discover)</li>
</ul>
Since I've been at the library:
<ul>
  <li>ETL and Report Development using JasperETL, Unix shell scripts and Perl for the custom built reporting front end against Oracle.  This was later rewritten to MySQL for cost/maintainability reasons, and now I know all about <del>repairing</del> running MyISAM tables in a large data environment :-)</li>
  <li>PHP / MySQL</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails / JQuery / CoffeeScript / SCSS / Microdata via schema.org</li>
  <li>Mobile site development using a combination of Rails, JQuery Mobile and iOS and Android apps via PhoneGap</li>
</ul>


<h2>With a UX Obsession</h2>
I've always been a developer, but by far I'm best at figuring out how to use software to solve problems for users.  It's what drove me to choose to get into computers in the first place - in my high school retail work we had to use a point-of-sale system which used the F5 key to finish the order - right next to the F4 key that completely wipe out the order, without verification first.  (seriously, though, who would do this ?!)
I knew that I could write better software than that.

<h2>What Drives Me</h2>
Being in an agile workplace, I'm interested in figuring out ways to integrate UX work with the fast-moving/ever iterating sprints.


And, what I like to do in my free time:
 <ul>
  <li>Craft Beer, brewhouses</li>
  <li>Various house projects - especially decorating, browsing pinterest or ikeahackers for inspiration</li>
  <li>Biking/Cycling (but not at the same time as craft beer)</li>
  <li>Playing board games with friends, especially Dominion :-)</li>
  <li>Playing games on iPad.  I used to do video games a lot more heavily but the Angry Birds, etc. are so addictive!</li>
  <li>Playing bass guitar or piano.  I've been in a few bands in the Chicago-land area - Ballistic Edna, Livid Vivian and Burnside Bridge</li>
  <li>Creating/designing chainmail and other metal jewelry</li>
</ul>
