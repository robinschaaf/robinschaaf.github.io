<h3>Father Hesburgh Digital Archives</h3>
This is my most recent completed project at the library - a pilot project for building a website about Father Hesburgh's role in the Civil Rights era.  
The most notable challenge about this project is that the primary audience is for potential donors (think "flashy"), but it is intended to serve as a scholarly research tool.

<h3>CurateND Project</h3>
CurateND is an institutional repository project that has been ongoing by another team within my organization.  I've been asked to provide occasional UX design on a consultative basis for them, including "Responsive-izing" their design.
Axure Share Prototypes:  <a href="http://fxx75m.axshare.com">http://fxx75m.axshare.com</a>  (unfortunately at some point in upgrading Axure my responsive template bungled up)
