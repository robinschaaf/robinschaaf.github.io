<h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
I've been in database/web development since getting my B.S. in Computer Technology from Purdue in 2001. Over the years, this has meant:
<ul>
<li>(The standards): HTML, Javascript (yes, pre-jQuery!), CSS</li>
<li>Perl / Postgresql - In my spare time I developed a user-content driven site, mailleartisans.org, which is still in use today. This was done in about 2002, well before myspace started or other user content driven sites. If only I'd picked something with broader appeal than chainmail! :-)</li>
<li>Coldfusion / Oracle, and some Java (while I worked for Discover Financial)</li>
<li>ETL Development, Data Mart/Data Warehousing with Ab Initio (also at Discover)</li>
</ul>
Since I've been at the library:
<ul>
<li>ETL and Report Development using JasperETL, Unix shell scripts and Perl for the custom built reporting front end against Oracle. This was later rewritten to MySQL for cost/maintainability reasons, and now I know all about <del>repairing</del> running MyISAM tables in a large data environment :-)</li>
<li>PHP / MySQL</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails / JQuery / CoffeeScript / SCSS / Microdata via schema.org</li>
<li>Mobile site development using a combination of Rails, JQuery Mobile and iOS and Android apps via PhoneGap</li>
</ul>

 <p class="small">*  This is my most recent application developed last year.  Unfortunately, it requires a log in to see the user-administration end which is pretty cool.  It allows employees to self-administer - including a markdown editor for their "About" section.  This was developed using Rails and various gems, using coffeescript and scss.</p>

<p class="small">*  This is an internal application, I'll have screenshots coming soon!</p>

<p class="small">*  I also repackaged this as android and iOS apps using PhoneGap (the repository is available in github).  It, unfortunately, did not make it into the Apple Store.  They cited that it wasn't entertaining, which is true enough - since it's a library catalog.</p>

<br />
<p class="small">*  This is a drupal marketing site I developed to advertise the open-source ERMS project, called CORAL.  CORAL was the result of over two years of user-centered development work, presentations at conferences, and feedback and support from other institutions.  More than forty other confirmed institutions use CORAL, and there are now a handful of other sites who are regularly contributing to the code on GitHub.</p>
